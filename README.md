course project for dirtribute and parallel computing



Project One.

A simple project for chandy-lamport snapshot algorithm
future work:
1.make less threads
2.change and snapshot the channel value
3.something different between the algorithms,how to demonstrate the channel value?
use a arraylist or just a Integer?
